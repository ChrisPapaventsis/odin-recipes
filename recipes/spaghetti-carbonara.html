    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Spaghetti Carbonara is a classic Italian pasta dish from Rome. It is known for its creamy sauce made from eggs, cheese, pancetta, and pepper. The dish is rich and flavorful, with a silky texture that comes from the emulsion of the egg mixture and pasta water.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Spaghetti</li>
        <li>Pancetta or guanciale (cut into small pieces)</li>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the spaghetti in a large pot of salted boiling water until al dente.</li>
        <li>While the pasta cooks, heat a large skillet over medium heat and add the pancetta or guanciale. Cook until crispy.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, whisk together eggs, Pecorino Romano, Parmesan, and a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper.</li>
        <li>Drain the spaghetti, reserving about 1 cup of pasta water.</li>
