    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Lasagna is a traditional Italian dish renowned for its layered structure and rich, savory flavors. 
        Typically, it consists of alternating layers of wide, flat pasta sheets, a robust meat or vegetable ragù, 
        creamy béchamel sauce, and generous amounts of cheese, often including ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan. 
        The dish is assembled in a deep baking dish and cooked until the pasta is tender, the sauces meld harmoniously, and the top is golden and bubbling. 
        Lasagna is celebrated for its versatility, with numerous regional and contemporary variations that incorporate diverse ingredients and spices, 
        making it a beloved staple in both Italian cuisine and global culinary practices.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>In a large pot, cook the ground beef or Italian sausage over medium heat until browned. Drain excess fat.</li>

        <li>Stir in tomato sauce, tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, and water. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Season with sugar, fresh basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, salt, and black pepper. Simmer for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese, egg, and fresh parsley. Mix until well blended.</li>
        <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Spread 1/3 of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
